Line-Following LEGO Robot with LeJOS
Project Description
This project focuses on developing a LEGO robot capable of following a line using sensors, powered by the LeJOS software framework. Threading was utilized in the robot for task management and real-time tracking, enabling smooth and precise movement along the line.

Technologies Used
Programming Environment: LeJOS
Language: Java
Concurrency: Java Threading

Features:
Real-time line tracking with sensors
Threaded task management to enhance real-time performance and accuracy also dynamic response to obstacles and line alterations

Learning Experiences and Achievements:
During this project, I gained valuable experience in concurrent programming and real-time systems. I also learned how to integrate and utilize sensors in robotics and how to apply programming skills to physical devices and automation. Throughout the project, I developed an understanding of thread safety and real-time signal processing, enhancing my ability to work with complex and concurrent systems.
